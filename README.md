- **Testing:** Safely test changes.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work simultaneously.

### Process
1. **Create Branch:** Name and create it on GitHub.
2. **Make Changes:** Switch to the branch, modify, and commit.
3. **Push Branch:** Upload the branch to GitHub.
4. **Merge Branch:** Open a pull request, review, and merge into the main branch.__


Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
__**pull request** proposes changes to a repository, enabling code reviews and collaboration.

### Benefits
- **Code Review:** Allows for detailed code reviews and comments.
- **Discussion:** Facilitates team discussions on changes.
- **Approval:** Ensures changes are reviewed and approved before merging.

### Steps
1. **Create Pull Request:** Push branch, navigate to "Pull requests," click "New pull request," fill in details, and create.
2. **Review Pull Request:** Go to "Pull requests," select the pull request, review changes, comment, approve, and merge.__


GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
__**GitHub Actions** automate workflows for CI/CD.

### Usage
- **Workflows:** Defined in YAML files.
- **Triggers:** Events like push or pull request.
- **Actions:** Reusable tasks.

### Simple CI/CD Pipeline Example

1. **Create Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. **Define Workflow:**
   ```yaml
   name: CI Pipeline

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
   ```
